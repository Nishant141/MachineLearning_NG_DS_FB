# **App Name**: Regression Analysis Suite

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion and Preparation: Import data from various sources (CSV, Excel) and prepare it for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
- Automated Feature Scaling: Automatically scale numerical features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
- Model Training and Prediction: Train a linear regression model on the prepared data to predict a continuous numeric target.
- Performance Metrics Calculation: Calculate and display key performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² to evaluate model accuracy.
- Assumption Checker: Tool to help evaluate assumptions of Linear Regression (linearity, multicollinearity) and guide data transformation.
- Regression Line Visualization: If the input has only one feature, generate a scatter plot of the test data overlaid with the regression line.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7EC4CF) to convey trustworthiness and data focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), very desaturated to provide a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#9CB4CC) for interactive elements and key data points.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a clean, modern, and readable design.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different data sources, metrics, and analysis steps.
- Arrange data input fields, analysis results, and visualization in a clear, logical layout. Consider using a grid system for alignment.
- Subtle animations for data loading and metric updates.
